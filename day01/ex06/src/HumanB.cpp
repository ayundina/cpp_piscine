/*
Weapon class:

_type string
getType() - returns a reference to _type string
setType()


HumanA class: 
HumanB class:
Weapon ^
name
attack() - displays "NAME attacks with his WEAPON_TYPE"

code produces attacks with 
"crude spiked club"
THEN
"some other type of club", in both test cases:

store the Weapon as a pointer? As a reference?
Why? Is it the best choice in light of whatâ€™s asked? 
These are the questions you should ask yourself before turning in this exercise.

		HumanA bob("Bob", club);
		bob.attack();
		club.setType("some other type of club");
		bob.attack();
