/*

Add the following public constructors and public member functions to your class:

1. constructor (takes a constant integer) and converts it to
the correspondant fixed(8) point value. The fractional bits value is initialized
like in ex00.

2. constructor (takes a constant floating point) and converts
it to the correspondant fixed(8) point value. The fractional bits value is
initialized like in ex00.

3. member function:
float toFloat( void ) const;
converts the fixed point value to a floating point value.

4. member function:
int toInt( void ) const;
converts the fixed point value to an integer value.

You will also add the following function overload to your header (declaration)
and source (definition) files:
5. Â« operator:
inserts a floating point representation of the
fixed point value into the parameter output stream.
